# Type Checking Improvement Plan

## Current Issue
The type checking logic in `TyckPropagator.scala` has an unimplemented case for intersection types. In line 334, there's a placeholder marked with `???` for handling the case of unifying two intersection types:
```scala
case (Intersection(_, _), Intersection(_, _)) => ???
```

While Chester doesn't yet support declaring intersection types in the source code with an explicit syntax, they are still used internally. For example, integer literals are handled with intersection types in the type checker implementation.

## Proposed Improvement
Implement the missing case for intersection type unification to improve type checking robustness:

```scala
case (Intersection(types1, _), Intersection(types2, _)) =>
  // For intersection types to be compatible, each type from the second intersection
  // must be compatible with at least one type from the first intersection
  types2.forall(t2 => types1.exists(t1 => tryUnify(t1, t2)))
```

## Testing Approach
Since intersection types aren't directly expressible in Chester yet, we can test this change through integer literals, which internally use intersection types. For example:

```
// Test integer literals with different values
// (these use intersection types internally)
let a: Integer = 42;    // Positive integer
let b: Integer = -5;    // Negative integer
```

We can also test different arithmetic operations and function calls that involve integers, since the internal handling will exercise the intersection type logic.

## Expected Benefits
1. More robust type checking for internal intersection types
2. Elimination of the unimplemented case (the current `???` placeholder)
3. Foundation for future explicit intersection type support in Chester
