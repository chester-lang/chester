# Chester

Welcome to the Chester Programming Language documentation! Chester is a modern, expressive language designed to combine the best features of functional and object-oriented programming paradigms.

## What is Chester?

Chester is a statically-typed language that aims to provide a balance between expressiveness and safety. It draws inspiration from languages like Scala, Haskell, and Rust, while introducing its own unique features.

Some key characteristics of Chester include:

- Strong type system with type inference
- Support for both functional and object-oriented programming styles
- Pattern matching and algebraic data types
- Effect system for managing side effects
- Unicode support, allowing for expressive identifiers

## A Glimpse of Chester

Let's take a look at a simple Chester program to get a feel for the language:

```chester
module 😿😿;

def me: String = "インターネット・エンジェル";
```
