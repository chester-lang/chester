# Current Implementation Status

## Type System Features

### Intersection Types
- Intersection types are partially implemented in the type checker
- They are used internally (e.g., for handling integer literal types)
- There is an incomplete case in `TyckPropagator.scala` (line 334) for unifying two intersection types:
  ```scala
  case (Intersection(_, _), Intersection(_, _)) => ???
  ```
- No explicit syntax for declaring intersection types in Chester code yet
- When testing type checking with intersection types:
  - Use existing types that internally leverage intersection types (e.g., integer literals)
  - Remember that types like `NaturalType`, `IntType`, and `UIntType` are defined in the codebase but not yet exposed in the built-in scope
  - Only use `Integer` for testing as it's in the current built-in scope

### Union Types
- Union types are implemented and can be expressed with the `|` operator
- Example: `Integer | String`
- Type checking for unions works for basic cases
- Complex union types (especially with intersection types) may not be fully supported yet

## Package System Status

### Package Declaration
- The package system is currently only a stub
- Module declarations (e.g., `module prelude;`) exist in the codebase but aren't fully implemented
- No actual package loading or resolution is supported yet
- Packages folder structure exists but should not be relied upon

### Built-in Types and Functions
- Only a limited set of built-in types is currently available in the scope
- `Integer` is available and can be used in tests
- Many other types like `NaturalType`, `IntType`, `UIntType` are defined in the codebase but aren't yet exposed in the built-in scope
- When writing tests, only use types that are confirmed to be in the built-in scope (primarily `Integer`)

## Development Implications
- When working on type checker improvements, focus on basic use cases with supported types
- Test files should only use types currently in the built-in scope (primarily `Integer`)
- Avoid writing tests that depend on the package system or modules
