# Type Checking System Improvement Proposal

This document outlines specific proposed improvements to Chester's type checking system, focusing on dependent types and edge cases discovered during implementation.

## Background

Building on the improvements documented in `dependent-type-implementation-plan.md`, we've identified additional areas where the type checking system can be enhanced to better support dependent types and improve overall robustness.

## Current Status

Key improvements already made:
- Enhanced the `reduceTypeStructure` method in `NaiveReducer` to properly handle complex type structures
- Fixed the `areAlphaEquivalent` method in `TyckPropagator` to properly fall back to equality checking
- Improved handling of `TelescopeTerm` objects in function types for alpha-equivalence checks
- Added bound variable tracking in alpha-equivalence to better handle dependent types
- Improved documentation of key methods
- Enhanced record field access to properly handle dependent types

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Improvements

1. **Enhanced Alpha-Equivalence with Variable Binding**
   - Updated `areAlphaEquivalent` to track bound variables
   - Added proper handling for LocalV objects
   - Improved documentation explaining alpha-equivalence concepts

2. **Improved Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive documentation to `areAlphaEquivalent`
   - Added documentation to `typesEquivalentModuloOrdering`
   - Added documentation to `tryUnify` specifically about alpha-equivalence
   - Updated method signatures to reflect improved functionality

3. **Improved Record Field Access**
   - Added type-level reduction in `RecordFieldPropagator`
   - Ensured proper context handling for dependent fields
   - Fixed context issues

### Remaining Work

1. **Create Specialized Test Cases for Dependent Types**
   - A draft test file has been created at `docs/src/dev/DependentTypeTest.scala.todo`
   - Need to fix imports and adjust for Chester's testing infrastructure
   - Implement proper test cases for each dependent type scenario

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider memoization for repeated alpha-equivalence checks
   - Optimize union and intersection type comparisons
   - Add benchmarks to measure impact of improvements

## Testing

All existing tests pass with our current implementation improvements. The future implementation of specific dependent type tests will help further validate the enhanced type checking system.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Test Implementation**
   - Fix the `DependentTypeTest.scala.todo` file
   - Ensure proper imports and test infrastructure
   - Implement each test case to verify all aspects of dependent type handling

2. **Performance Enhancement**
   - Investigate memoization options
   - Consider adding a cache for alpha-equivalence results
   - Measure performance impact of changes

3. **Documentation**
   - Add examples to the codebase
   - Consider creating a dependent type guide for users
   - Document common patterns and issues with dependent types

## Success Criteria

1. All tests pass, including the specialized dependent type tests
2. The type checking system correctly handles complex dependent type scenarios
3. Documentation clearly explains dependent type concepts and usage patterns
