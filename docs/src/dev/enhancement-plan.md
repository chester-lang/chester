# Documentation Enhancement Plan

After reviewing the Chester development documentation, here are proposed improvements to make the docs more practical and developer-friendly.

## General Principles for All Docs

1. **Add Status Indicators**: Add clear status indicators (‚úÖ, üü°, ‚ùå) for features
2. **Improve Readability**: Use more tables, bullet points, and formatting for better scanning
3. **Code References**: Include more direct references to code locations
4. **Practical Guidelines**: Focus more on what developers can do now vs. theoretical design

## File-Specific Improvements

### README.md

Current state: Good overview but could be improved.

Suggested improvements:
- Add a "Quick Start" section for new contributors
- Include a brief glossary of key concepts/terms
- Add links to important code files for each component

### development.md

Current state: Good practices but dense text.

Suggested improvements:
- Convert text-heavy sections to bulleted lists
- Add a troubleshooting section for common issues
- Improve the formatting of code examples
- Add a checklist for PR submissions

### propagator-network.md

Current state: Very detailed but technical and dense.

Suggested improvements:
- Add a high-level visual diagram of the propagator network
- Create a "Common Propagator Types" table with examples
- Break up longer code examples with explanatory text
- Add a section on debugging propagator issues

### union-type-analysis.md

Current state: Good analysis but could be more practical.

Suggested improvements:
- Consolidate the implementation plan into a clearer roadmap
- Add examples of working union type syntax
- Create a decision tree for type unification cases
- Add more concrete examples of failure cases and their error messages

### parser-migration.md

Current state: Comprehensive but could be better organized.

Suggested improvements:
- Reorganize the feature comparison table for better readability
- Add a migration checklist for developers
- Include more concrete syntax examples for each feature
- Create a visual timeline of the migration process

## Implementation Priority

1. **implementation-status.md**: ‚úÖ Already improved
2. **propagator-network.md**: High priority - core to type system understanding
3. **development.md**: Medium priority - affects all contributors
4. **union-type-analysis.md**: Medium priority - important for type system work
5. **parser-migration.md**: Lower priority - already detailed enough
6. **README.md**: Lower priority - already serviceable
