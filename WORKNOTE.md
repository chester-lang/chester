# Chester Development Work Notes

## Current Focus: Semantic Module Type System

### Goal
Plan to fix type checking issues in the semantic module, particularly focusing on record types and lazy reduction.

### Problems to Address

1. **Type Mismatch in Record Construction**
   - Issue: Type mismatch between `truffle.Type` and `truffle.TupleType`
   - Root Cause: Platform-specific type handling leaking into core type system
   - Status: ðŸ”„ To be fixed by implementing platform-agnostic type unification

2. **Record Field Access**
   - Issue: Incorrect handling of field access in lazy reduction
   - Status: ðŸ”„ To be implemented with proper record type construction

3. **Type System Architecture**
   - Issue: Unclear separation between platform-specific and core types
   - Status: ðŸ”„ To be documented in `docs/src/development/type-system-architecture.md`

### Planned Implementation Changes

1. **Type Checking**
   - Add proper type unification in `Tycker`
   - Implement record type construction
   - Fix argument-level type checking

2. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive type system architecture guide
   - Add best practices for type checking
   - Document record type handling

### Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Add more test cases for record type edge cases
   - Test cross-platform type compatibility
   - Verify lazy reduction behavior

2. **Documentation**
   - Add examples of common type checking patterns
   - Document error handling best practices
   - Create troubleshooting guide

3. **Code Quality**
   - Remove remaining platform-specific type references
   - Improve error messages
   - Add more type safety checks

### Open Questions

1. How should we handle type-level computation in record fields?
2. What's the best way to optimize lazy reduction for large record types?
3. Should we add runtime type information for debugging?

### Timeline

- **Feb 9, 2025**: Initial planning and problem identification
- **Next**: Begin implementation of core fixes
- **Future**: Testing, documentation, and optimization
